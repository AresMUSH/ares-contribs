# Cortex Plot Points

If you spend plot points, you can add dice to your roll.  One plot point gets you an extra d2, two gets you d4, and so on up the step chart.  No matter what you roll, you have a minimum bonus equal to the number of plot points spent.  You can also use plot points at the storyteller's discretion for special effects to get yourself out of a jam.
