# FFG Destiny Points

Destiny Points are an artifact of the FFG Star Wars system, but can be applied to any theme as luck or plot points.  Admins award Destiny Points, and you can spend them to give your character an edge 

> Note: The destiny points spend command just records the fact that you spent points; you have to manually include their effects in your next roll.
