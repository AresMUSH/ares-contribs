# FFG Abilities

FFG has three kinds of abilities:  Characteristics, Skills and Talents.

* Characteristics represent basic abilities all characters possess.  They're rated from 1-5, with 2 representing average human ability.
* Skills represent training and knowledge.  They're also rated from 1-5, with 2 representing basic competence.
* Talents are special abilities or tricks that a character can use to do cool feats.  Some talents are rated from 1-5; others you either have or don't have.

Skills and talents are influenced by your character's career.  Some careers allow *specializations*, which further focus your character's skills.  You can have multiple specializations.
